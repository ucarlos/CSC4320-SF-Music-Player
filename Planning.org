* TODO Milestones
** DONE Setup Database
*** DONE What Database are you going to use?
At this point, I see that I should go ahead and use SQLite.
*** DONE I need some form of tag reader
**** [#B] Taglib (C++) [REJECTED]
+ Fast
+ No dependencies
+ Supports MP3, Vorbis, Flac, MPC, Speex, WavPack, TrueAudio, WAV, AIFF, MP4 and ASF
- Requires a bridge between java and c++
- Has be to connected to Android somehow
**** DONE [#A] ealvatag (Java) 
+ Written in Java
+ Supports MP3, Flac, Vorbis, Mp4, Aiff, Wav, Wma, and DSF
- Requires Dependencies to run
- Slower  
*** DONE How should audio data be stored in a database?
- ID - incrementing uint32_t, each track has a unique id.
- Track Title -- Variable String
- Track Number -- int32_t
- Artist Name -- Variable String
- Album Artist Name -- Variable String
- Album Name -- Variable String
- Year -- either uint16_t or uint32_t
- location in file_path -- Variable String
*** Default Audio Setup
** TODO Setup a database connector - <2020-11-05 Thu>
- <2020-11-04 Wed>: DatabaseTrack connects to DatabaseContract class to insert
  a track into the database. Insertion works, but I need to prevent duplicates from being entered into the database. I also don't know if I should create another class to handle that.
** TODO Test Audio playback
*** TODO Read about MediaPlayer and how it works
*** Test Audio Playback in another application/project
*** Try to integrate it as the main activity/fragment
** TODO Test File System Navigation
*** Learn how to navigate the android file system to add a file
*** Only display directories and acceptable audio files
*** Click on a file should create a DatabaseTrack object
** Polish it up!
*** Improve UI
*** Fix any bugs in the application
*** Improve application performance

* Activities needed
- Main Activity
- Filesystem Activity
- Database Activity
* Icons
- I need a list of icons to use?
- Maybe get an icon pack somewhere?  
* Database Details
Example
* Multithreading
Each aspect of the application should have a single thread.
- Database Read/Write
- Audio Playback
- File Management
